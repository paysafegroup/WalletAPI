# Paysafe Payments & Wallets API

Paysafe's digital wallet offering caters to merchants that need to implement **embedded finance services** into their products, such as marketplaces, e-commerce, electronic goods and more.

By leveraging Paysafe's capabilities - ledger, multiple currencies within the same wallet, multiple region coverage, risk and AML monitoring and a multitude of payment options, a product can be easily enhanced with an out-of-the-box, compliant e-money wallet.

Built on top of Paysafe's solid payment processing API infrastructure, digital wallet requires minimal enhancement in terms of integration, authentication and monitoring.

The service can easily and securely process payments & wallet requests from your customers using one single API – The **Payments & Wallets API**.

Paysafe's all-in-one [Business Portal](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal) allows the merchant to access transaction analytics and manage the merchant account.

# Overview


## Concepts in Paysafe's digital wallet

The digital wallet is a stored value financial service, and as such must adhere to certain regulations and data availability requirements.

**Customer** is the physical person, associated with a wallet, and is the legal owner of the e-money stored in the accounts' ledger. Regulations require Paysafe to collect and assess KYC information, PEP checks, and in some instances - carry out EDD verifications on the customer. A customer has a wallet associated with it.

A **Wallet Account** is a ledger for a single currency. The multicurrency capability requires multiple accounts to be associated with the wallet.

**Merchant** is a legal entity that provides services or goods to its customers. The merchant also has a wallet associated with it within the Paysafe Digital Wallet platform, and just as customers, KYB information must be collected and assessed.


## Digital Wallet as a service

On top of Paysafe regular wallet offering, the digital wallet can also be used purely as a backend service by operating a set of APIs.

Merchant's responsibilities:

  * Manage customer profiles
  * Take the customer through KYC (Know Your Customer), and share the information with Paysafe for regulatory purposes
  * Implement UI for all customer journeys
  * Integrate into the Paysafe's Payments and Digital Wallets API

Paysafe Digital Walet responsibilities:

  * Maintain e-money ledger
  * Maintain customer details for regulatory purposes
  * Monitor for Risk & AML
  * Integrate additional payment methods
  * Provide reporting capabilities


### Customer wallet

Each customer is assigned a CW, and it accounts for all transactions for that customer - deposits, withdrawals, pay-in m pay-out, exchange, etc. As mentioned above, a wallet can contain multiple accounts in different currencies.

When the Merchant deems necessary, a new Customer wallet is created. Usually, a customer wallet is created when the customer registers in the Merchant's system and passess the KYC verifications, as agreed between the Merchant and Paysafe.

> As the Merchant is managing all its users, Paysafe **only holds the customer personal details necessary for risk & compliance purposes** - Paysafe does not access or manage customer credentials, nor does it manage authentication and authorization. These details are associated with every wallet.


### Merchant wallet

The Merchant wallet, just as CW, provides ledger, transactional and multi-currency capabilities.

The Merchant can access the Merchant Wallet via the Paysafe Merchant Portal. Access to this portal is provided during the merchant onboarding process.


### Merchant Fees

All Merchant fees that the Merchant needs to charge its customers, are **accumulated in the MW at time of customer transaction**. Paysafe's fees can either be deducted directly from the MW balance, or can be settled on a monthly/quarterly basis by invoicing the Merchant.

To allow for the ultimate flexibility, all merchant fees **must be provided by the Merchant on a per-transaction basis**. This approach allows the Merchant to execute different pricing schemes based on regions, currency, customer loyalty levels, dynamic fee structures and other information that is only available to the Merchant.


## Payment Methods

Payment Methods represent your customer's payment instruments. They are used to collect payments or store instrument details for future payments.
The Payments API currently supports the following payment methods:

- Cards - credit and debit
- Rapid Transfer
- Bank transfers

> **Note:** Rapid Transfer is only supported for Payments.

> **Note:** Bank transfers is only supported for Standalone Credits.


## Transaction Types Supported
Payments API supports the following transaction types:

  * [Payment Handles](#paymenthandlerequest)
  * [Payments](#paymentrequest)
  * [Standalone Credits](#standalonecreditrequest)


## Payment Flows

One-step payment gateway refers to payment integrations where authorization/capture of funds occurs at the same time. This is relatively common for many alternative payment methods where the customer authenticates and authorizes the payment through a channel provided by the PSP. Typically, once the customer has authorized the payment, funds are immediately allocated and confirmed by the PSP.

Only supports settleWithAuth=true
For these integrations, corresponding Payment and Settlement resources are created simultaneously to represent the transaction. Both resources utilize the same unique GUID as are created from the same request. For these integrations, the Payment should reflect the same status as the Settlement and can be used to indicate success or failure of the transaction request without having to do a separate lookup on the specific settlement.

# Before you begin
## Get your Secret API Key
<a name="apikeys" title="Get your API Keys"></a>
The API uses a distinct API key:<br/>
* The Secret Key – used for all server-to-server API requests.

You can retrieve your Secret key for your account via the [Business Portal](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal/login).

<a name="secretapikey" title="Secret API Key"></a>
#### Secret API Key
You use the Secret API key in all your server-to-server API requests.

 > **Note:** You must Base64 Encode your Secret API key before using it in your API requests.

To retrieve your Secret API key from the Business Portal:
 1. Go to **Integrate>API Keys**.
 2. Under **Secret Key**, click **Authenticate Now**.
 ![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/Secret_Key1.png)
 3. Enter your Business Portal password and click **Authenticate**.
 4. You can now access your Secret API key.
 ![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/Secret_Key2.png)

 > **Note:** All your APIs will use the same API key.

Your API key will have the following format:
* Key Username – MerchantXYZKey
* Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The API key is case-sensitive and sent using HTTP Basic Authentication.
To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request.

You must construct the Authorization header as follows:
1. Combine the Key Username and Key Password into a string separated by a colon, for example, “Key Username:Key Password”.
2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
3. The authorization method and space (That is, “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the above Key Username and Password, the header is formed as follows:

```Authorization: Basic TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=```
For additional details, please refer [Authentication](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/reference-information/important-integration-concepts/authentication/).

## Testing

Test accounts enable you to process API transactions that mirror the functionality of the Production environment.

Transactions processed in the Test environment are executed on a simulator. Depending on the information provided with the transaction request, the simulator returns either a successful (approved) or failed (declined) response.

With the API, you can:

* Verify support for all the operation types that you require.
* Review all common errors as well as unique errors that may occur for each operation.
* Verify the length and format for all attributes you send.

For access to Test accounts and credentials, contact your account manager or reach out to <integrations@paysafe.com>.
Your Test account has access to the Test version of the Paysafe [Business Portal](https://merchant.test.paysafe.com/portal#/login), where you can view the status of your Test transactions.

###  Test URL
To test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URLs:

`https://api2.test.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/`

`https://api2.test.paysafe.com/digitalwallets/v1/` (under construction)


For example:

`https://api2.test.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/payments/{payment_id}`

Paysafe offers multiple payment methods to process your transaction. You can obtain detailed testing information on each payment method by clicking the corresponding link below:
* [Card]()


## Going Live

Once you are satisfied with your integration to the Test environment, you must repeat the configuration changes made to your Test account on your Production account.

> **Note:** You cannot use your Test credentials to process transaction requests in the Production environment.

### Go Live Checklist
1. You must have a production account and access to Business Portal.
2. You must have a Secret API Key for the production environment.
3. You must have Webhooks configured for all the events.
4. You must use the Production URL for your API calls.

### Production URL
To process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:

`https://api2.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/`
`https://api2.paysafe.com/digitalwallets/v1/`

For example:

`https://api2.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/payments/{payment_id}`
`https://api2.paysafe.com/digitalwallets/v1/customers`

# Getting started


## Onboard a customer

Onboarding a customer requires a new wallet to be created on the Paysafe side.

Business requirements for creating a new wallet:

* KYC verifications passed - a flag must be passed when creating a customer wallet that denotes that, and is the proof that Paysafe accepts that the customer was indeed verified. If the value of this flag is different than ``, the wallet creation will fail
* Terms and conditions accepted - this flag is needed as proof that the Merchant has presented the Paysafe T&Cs to the customer, and the customer has accepted these T&Cs. If this flag has a value different than `true`, the wallet creation will fail.

Call [Create Wallet](#reference/wallets/create-wallet/create-wallet), with the following requirements for the data being passed in the body of the request:

* `customer` - all required fields must be fully populated - Paysafe needs this information for regulatory purposes.

* `accounts` - at least one account object has to be populated; please refer to Merchant's agreement with Paysafe for a list of supported wallet currencies. If an unsupported currency is passed, or if two Account objects with the same currency are provided, creating the wallet will fail.
    * when creating a new wallet, `totalBalance` and `availableBalance` must be equal
    * when `hasIban == true`, a new Virtual IBAN will be allocated for this customer for that account & currency

* `identityDocuments` - metadata about all documents, submitted by the Customer during the KYC & EDD process

![Diagram: Onboarding a customer](https://github.com/paysafegroup/WalletAPI/raw/Wallet-API-updates/diagrams/0-Wallet-create.svg)

When creating a wallet for an **newly signed-up customer**, the `totalBalance` and `availableBalance` fields for all `account` objects must be set to 0.

If the wallet is created for an existing customer with an existing balance, the fields `totalBalance` and `availableBalance` must both be populated with the same amount that represents the desired initial balance for this customer. When creating the wallets, Paysafe will debit the amounts specified from the Merchant wallet, and credit these amounts into the customer's wallet.

> TODO: Better wording for cases when creating a wallet can fail

In case the email provided is not unique and a wallet is already created
using this email address, the creation of a new wallet will fail.

After creating the wallet, the customer could be restricted on Paysafe side
based on regulatory and risk checks.


### Update customer details

Customer's details could be updated on the Merchant's app/portal, and these updates must be reflected on the Paysafe side, for regulatory purposes.

Customer profile information can be updated by calling [Update Customer](#reference/customers/get-customer/update-customer).

The following fields cannot be updated, and an attempt to do so will result in an error:

* id
* registrationIp


### Deactivate a customer

When a customer closes their account with the Merchant, the digital wallet on the Paysafe side must be deactivated.

The API [Deactivate Customer](#reference/customers/get-customer/deactivate-customer) must be used to achieve that.


### Accounts

Account information can be retrieved with the following APIs:

* Get a list of all accounts for a customer - [Get Account List](#reference/wallets/get-account-list/get-account-list)
* Get details and current balance for an account - [Get Account](#reference/wallets/get-account/get-account)

Direct update and delete acounts is not supported via API.

# API
The API is constructed around REST and has following features:
* Definite resource-oriented URLs
* Receives form-encoded request bodies
* Returns JSON-encoded responses
* Communicates using standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

* **Message body**: This must contain valid Paysafe JSON objects as required for the type of request. Not all API calls require a message-body; for example, GET requests do not require a body.
* **Resource ID**: Identifies the unique ID of a resource.

<a name="paymentswebhooks" title="Payments Webhooks"></a>
# Webhooks

A Webhook is an HTTP callback that is triggered when an event takes place.
To configure webhooks, you need to [open a service request](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal/login) with Paysafe in the Business Portal.

For more information on Webhooks, click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/webhooks/).

> **Note:** To receive webhooks from Paysafe, you must create a callback URL to receive the webhook that is triggered.
You are responsible for ensuring its continued availability.

## Some Notes on Webhooks

+ When the status of one of your transaction request changes, Paysafe immediately sends a callback to your webhook's endpoint URL to inform you of the status change.
+ To acknowledge the receipt of the webhook, Paysafe expects an HTTP status of 200 OK or 202 ACCEPTED from your endpoint. In case we receive any other HTTP status code, we assume that you have not received the webhook, and we attempt to resend it.
+ If Paysafe does not get an acknowledgment of receipt with an HTTP Status Code of 200 or 202, it makes a maximum of 2 additional attempts (total 3 attempts) to send a callback to that URL.
+ As Paysafe does not have a notification method to alert you when callbacks are not reaching your endpoint URL, you should make sure that there is continued availability of your endpoint.
+ All endpoint URLs should use HTTPS/SSL to ensure security. Please note that only the default **HTTPS port 443** is supported.
+ In case you have received the same notification multiple times for an already processed event, we request you to ignore the duplicate notification. It is recommended to make the notification URL endpoints idempotent.


# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters  as described in this [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/pagination/).

<a name="globalinvalidcharacters" title="Global Invalid Characters"></a>
# Global Invalid Characters

You must not include any of the characters in this [table](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/global-invalid-characters/) as values in any of your request parameters. Object. If you do, your request will result in an error.

<a name="isostandards" title="ISO Standards"></a>
# ISO Standards

ISO standards add value by providing the common business process data semantics to be used in the API based exchanges. This [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/iso-standards/) presents you codes for four areas - Currency, Province, State, and Country.


Please refer [Miscellaneous](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/miscellaneous/) for Global Invalid Characters, ISO Standards, Currency Codes, Province Codes, State Codes, Country Codes.

The reason for this state might be because of some system or environmental issues. </li></ul> By default, PaymentHandles will EXPIRE after 15 mins unless in a PROCESSING status.  Once the transaction flow has been initiated by the customer, the time permitted for the customer to complete authorization is dependent upon the payment type. PaymentHandles that lapse the permitted processing will be marked EXPIRED.If the customer is required to complete authorization as part of a redirect flow, the PaymentHandle is updated to have a PROCESSING status and the expiration time is extended to allow this additional time for the customer to complete these activities.For payment types where there is automatic settlement (settleWithAuth=true), if the PAYABLE Payment Handle has EXPIRED,  the corresponding Payment/Settlement resources will be auto created.  IF the PSP supports refunds, they will be auto refunded to the customer. |

# Using the Example API Calls (Console Window)

To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right-hand pane.
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. For example, for many lookup requests you must update the endpoint to include your request ID (for example, payment_id), which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the respective *id* value.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/ApiaryConsole.png)

You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64 version of your API key.
To get your Base64 encoded API key, sign in to the Business Portal and go to **Integrate>API Keys**.
![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/API_authorization.png)

When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:

- Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.
- Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

# Group Payment Handles

## Payment Handle [/paymenthub/v1/paymenthandles]

A Payment Handle represents tokenized information about the payment method that you set up for your customer. Once the Payment Handle is created, you can then include the *paymentHandleToken* returned in the Payment Handle request response in a new [payment request](#paymentrequest).
<br>
> **Note:** A Payment Handle can be used in a [Payment request](#paymentrequest) only if it has the status of **PAYABLE**.

### Create a Payment Handle [POST]
<a name="paymenthandlerequest" title="Create a Payment Handle"></a>

Click **Create a Payment Handle** above to see the examples of how to create a Payment Handle object:

* A Payment Handle for a standard credit card authorization
* A Payment Handle for a credit card that is registered for 3D Secure - the response for this request will contain a redirect to present to the customer so they can validate their 3D Secure credentials
* A Payment Handle for a credit card Standalone Credit

 > **Note:** The *status* of Payment Handles will remain INITIATED  for the following cases:
* When the customer is redirected to a *redirect_payment* URL until the customer verifies the payment instrument.
* When the requested amount is more than the maximum amount configured in the Business Portal.
* When Alternate Payment Methods like RapidTransfer, Paysafecash, Paysafecards are selected by the customer.
