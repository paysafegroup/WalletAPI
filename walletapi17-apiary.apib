# Paysafe Payments & Wallets API 

>**IMPORTANT:**  Because the Paysafe Payments & Wallets API uses its [own unique API keys for request authentication](#apikey) and provides its own [Test and Production accounts](#goinglive), you should never click the **SIGN UP** or **LOGIN** buttons at the top right of the 
Developer Center navigation, as these are used strictly for the other APIs on the Developer Center. Please contact your business relationship manager or reach out to <integrations@paysafe.com> for API keys and Test/Production accounts.

<a name="paymentsoverview" title="Payments & Wallets API Overview"></a>
# Overview

You can easily and securely process payments & wallet requests from your customers using one single API – The **Payments & Wallets API**.   

Paysafe also enables you to access your transaction analytics and manage accounts with our all-in-one [Business Portal](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal). 


## Payment Methods

Payment Methods represent your customer's payment instruments. They are used to collect payments or store instrument details for future payments.
The Payments API currently supports the following payment methods: 

- Card

 > **Note:** For payment methods using cards, we support both 3DS 1.0 and 3DS 2.0 


## Transaction Types Supported
Payments API supports the following transaction types:

  * [Payment Handles](#paymenthandlerequest)
  * [Payments](#paymentrequest)
  * [Standalone Credits](#standalonecreditrequest)

# Before you begin
## Get your Secret API Key
<a name="apikeys" title="Get your API Keys"></a>
The API uses a distinct API key:<br/>
* The Secret Key – used for all server-to-server API requests.

You can retrieve your Secret key for your account via the [Business Portal](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal/login).

<a name="secretapikey" title="Secret API Key"></a>
#### Secret API Key
You use the Secret API key in all your server-to-server API requests. 

 > **Note:** You must Base64 Encode your Secret API key before using it in your API requests.

To retrieve your Secret API key from the Business Portal: 
 1. Go to **Integrate>API Keys**.
 2. Under **Secret Key**, click **Authenticate Now**.
 ![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/Secret_Key1.png)
 3. Enter your Business Portal password and click **Authenticate**.
 4. You can now access your Secret API key. 
 ![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/Secret_Key2.png)
 
 > **Note:** All your APIs will use the same API key.

Your API key will have the following format:
* Key Username – MerchantXYZKey 
* Password – B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

The API key is case-sensitive and sent using HTTP Basic Authentication.
To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. 

You must construct the Authorization header as follows:
1. Combine the Key Username and Key Password into a string separated by a colon, for example, “Key Username:Key Password”.
2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
3. The authorization method and space (That is, “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the above Key Username and Password, the header is formed as follows:

```Authorization: Basic TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=```
For additional details, please refer [Authentication](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/reference-information/important-integration-concepts/authentication/).

## Testing

Test accounts enable you to process API transactions that mirror the functionality of the Production environment. 

Transactions processed in the Test environment are executed on a simulator. Depending on the information provided with the transaction request, the simulator returns either a successful (approved) or failed (declined) response.

With the API, you can:

* Verify support for all the operation types that you require.
* Review all common errors as well as unique errors that may occur for each operation.
* Verify the length and format for all attributes you send.

For access to Test accounts and credentials, contact your account manager or reach out to <integrations@paysafe.com>. 
Your Test account has access to the Test version of the Paysafe [Business Portal](https://merchant.test.paysafe.com/portal#/login), where you can view the status of your Test transactions. 

###  Test URL
To test your integration with Paysafe, use the following Test URL:

`https://api2.test.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/`

For example:

`https://api2.test.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/payments/{payment_id}`

Paysafe offers multiple payment methods to process your transaction. You can obtain detailed testing information on each payment method by clicking the corresponding link below:
* [Card]()


## Going Live
 
Once you are satisfied with your integration to the Test environment, you must repeat the configuration changes made to your Test account on your Production account.

> **Note:** You cannot use your Test credentials to process transaction requests in the Production environment.

### Go Live Checklist
1. You must have a production account and access to Business Portal.
2. You must have a Secret API Key for the production environment.
3. You must have Webhooks configured for all the events.
4. You must use the Production URL for your API calls.

### Production URL
To process live requests with Paysafe, use the following Production URL:

`https://api2.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/`
`https://api2.paysafe.com/digitalwallets/v1/`

For example:

`https://api2.paysafe.com/paymenthub/v1/payments/{payment_id}`
`https://api2.paysafe.com/digitalwallets/v1/customers`

# API
The API is constructed around REST and has following features:
* Definite resource-oriented URLs
* Receives form-encoded request bodies
* Returns JSON-encoded responses 
* Communicates using standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

* **Message body**: This must contain valid Paysafe JSON objects as required for the type of request. Not all API calls require a message-body; for example, GET requests do not require a body.
* **Resource ID**: Identifies the unique ID of a resource.
![Structure of a Typical API Request](http://mweb1-paysafeio-foreign.fra.skrill.net/fileadmin/user_upload/authentication_example_payments.png)
* **Payment Simulator**: While testing your integration, you can choose whether you want to simulate the actual end customer experience or you want to use a page, which lets you simulate all payment handle statuses.
You must use "**Simulator**" in the HTTP header of your request, which has the following possible values:
   * **"INTERNAL" (default)** – which redirects you to the **status** simulator page.
   * **"EXTERNAL"** – which redirects/connects you to the downstream payment method website (For Example: Skrill authentication page)

<a name="paymentswebhooks" title="Payments Webhooks"></a>
# Webhooks

A Webhook is an HTTP callback that is triggered when an event takes place. 
To configure webhooks, you need to [open a service request](https://merchant.paysafe.com/portal/login) with Paysafe in the Business Portal.

For more information on Webhooks, click [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/webhooks/).

> **Note:** To receive webhooks from Paysafe, you must create a callback URL to receive the webhook that is triggered. 
You are responsible for ensuring its continued availability.

## Some Notes on Webhooks

+ When the status of one of your transaction request changes, Paysafe immediately sends a callback to your webhook's endpoint URL to inform you of the status change. 
+ To acknowledge the receipt of the webhook, Paysafe expects an HTTP status of 200 OK or 202 ACCEPTED from your endpoint. In case we receive any other HTTP status code, we assume that you have not received the webhook, and we attempt to resend it.
+ If Paysafe does not get an acknowledgment of receipt with an HTTP Status Code of 200 or 202, it makes a maximum of 2 additional attempts (total 3 attempts) to send a callback to that URL.
+ As Paysafe does not have a notification method to alert you when callbacks are not reaching your endpoint URL, you should make sure that there is continued availability of your endpoint.
+ All endpoint URLs should use HTTPS/SSL to ensure security. Please note that only the default **HTTPS port 443** is supported.
+ In case you have received the same notification multiple times for an already processed event, we request you to ignore the duplicate notification. It is recommended to make the notification URL endpoints idempotent.


# Pagination

In the case where an API GET request returns multiple results, Paysafe returns the first 10 records by default and uses HATEOAS links to provide page navigation. In addition to the default behavior, it is also possible to control the number of results and starting point by passing in query parameters  as described in this [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/pagination/).

<a name="globalinvalidcharacters" title="Global Invalid Characters"></a>
# Global Invalid Characters

You must not include any of the characters in this [table](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/global-invalid-characters/) as values in any of your request parameters. Object. If you do, your request will result in an error.

<a name="isostandards" title="ISO Standards"></a>
# ISO Standards

ISO standards add value by providing the common business process data semantics to be used in the API based exchanges. This [section](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/iso-standards/) presents you codes for four areas - Currency, Province, State, and Country. 


Please refer [Miscellaneous](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/miscellaneous/) for Global Invalid Characters, ISO Standards, Currency Codes, Province Codes, State Codes, Country Codes.

# Using the Example API Calls (Console Window)

To configure and test the API examples, first click on one of the API calls in the API Reference section and then click **Switch to Console** in the right-hand pane. 
Using the Console window you can update the headers, the request body, and parts of the API endpoint. For example, for many lookup requests you must update the endpoint to include your request ID (for example, payment_id), which you do by selecting **URI Parameters** and then updating the respective *id* value. 

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/ApiaryConsole.png)

You must also update the Header to include your API Key by selecting **Headers** and then updating the **Authorization** value using the Base64 version of your API key.
To get your Base64 encoded API key, sign in to the Business Portal and go to **Integrate>API Keys**.
![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_paymenthub_v1/raw/master/images/API_authorization.png)

When you are ready to test your example, you can choose between the Production and Mock server environment:

- Production server – This calls the resource on Paysafe's Test system.
- Mock server – This environment simply returns the dummy values in the example response irrespective of the parameters you supply. You do not need to use your account ID or Test API key for this request.

To call the API resource, click **Call Resource**. The response is displayed in the Console window.

# Group Payment Handles

## Payment Handle [/v1/paymenthandles]

A Payment Handle represents tokenized information about the payment method that you set up for your customer. Once the Payment Handle is created, you can then include the *paymentHandleToken* returned in the Payment Handle request response in a new [payment request](#paymentrequest).  
<br>
> **Note:** A Payment Handle can be used in a [Payment request](#paymentrequest) only if it has the status of **PAYABLE**. 

### Create a Payment Handle [POST]
<a name="paymenthandlerequest" title="Create a Payment Handle"></a>

Click **Create a Payment Handle** above to see the examples of how to create a Payment Handle object:

* A Payment Handle for a standard credit card authorization
* A Payment Handle for a credit card that is registered for 3D Secure - the response for this request will contain a redirect to present to the customer so they can validate their 3D Secure credentials
* A Payment Handle for a credit card Standalone Credit

 > **Note:** The *status* of Payment Handles will remain INITIATED  for the following cases:
* When the customer is redirected to a *redirect_payment* URL until the customer verifies the payment instrument.
* When the requested amount is more than the maximum amount configured in the Business Portal.
* When Alternate Payment Methods like Paysafecash, Paysafecards are selected by the customer.
